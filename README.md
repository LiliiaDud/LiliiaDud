**Junior Front-End Developer** with experience in JavaScript, React, Next.js. 
I am currently completing my studies at GoIT IT School, where I am taking a Frontend Development course that is providing me with fundamental knowledge and best practices in modern web development. During my studies, I have worked with tools and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, SASS, Git, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, and have used them to create and deploy web projects.
